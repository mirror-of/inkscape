=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Inkscape> is a GUI editor for B<Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)> format
drawing files, with capabilities similar to B<Adobe Illustrator>,
B<CorelDraw>, B<Visio>, etc. Inkscape features include versatile
shapes, bezier paths, freehand drawing, multi-line text, 
alpha blending, transforms, gradients, node
editing, SVG-to-PNG export, grouping, patterns, and more.  The interface is
designed to be comfortable and efficient for skilled users, while
remaining conformant to B<GNOME> standards so that users familiar with
other GNOME applications can learn its interface rapidly.

B<SVG> is a W3C standard XML format for 2D vector drawing. It allows
defining objects in the drawing using points, paths, and primitive
shapes.  Colors, fonts, stroke width, and so forth are specified as
`style' attributes to these objects.  The intent is that since SVG is a
standard, and since its files are text/xml, it will be
possible to use SVG files in a sizeable number of programs and for a
wide range of uses.

B<Inkscape> uses SVG as its native document format, and has the goal of
becoming the most fully compliant drawing program for SVG files
available in the Open Source community.


=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item B<-?>, B<--help>

Show help message

=item B<-a> I<x0:y0:x1:y1>, B<--export-area>=I<x0:y0:x1:y1>

Exported area in SVG pixels (anonymous length units normally used in Inkscape SVG).
The default is to export the entire document page.
The point (0,0) is the lower-left corner.

=item B<-b> I<COLOR>, B<--export-background>=I<COLOR>

Background color of exported PNG.
This may be any SVG supported color string, for example "#ff007f" or "rgb(255, 0, 128)".
If not set,
then the page color set in Inkscape in the Document Options dialog will be used (stored in the pagecolor= attribute of sodipodi:namedview).

=item B<-d> I<DPI>, B<--export-dpi>=I<DPI>

The resolution used for bitmap export.
The default is 72, which corresponds to 1 SVG point (pt) exporting to 1 bitmap pixel.
This value overrides the DPI hint if used with --export-use-hints.

=item B<-e> I<FILENAME>, B<--export-png>=I<FILENAME>

Specify the filename for PNG export.
If it already exists, the file will be overwritten without asking.

=item B<-f> I<FILENAME>, B<--file>=I<FILENAME>

Open specified document(s).
Option string may be omitted, i.e. you can list the filenames without -f.

=item B<-g>, B<--with-gui>

Try to use the GUI (on Unix, use the X server even if $DISPLAY is not set).

=item B<-h> I<HEIGHT>, B<--export-height>=I<HEIGHT>

The height of generated bitmap in pixels.
This value overrides the --export-dpi setting (or the DPI hint if used with --export-use-hints). 

=item B<-i> I<ID>, B<--export-id>=I<ID>

The id attribute value of the object that you want to export from the document.
Exported is the bounding box of the object, so with this option, --export-area is ignored. 

=item B<-l>, B<--export-plain-svg>=I<FILENAME>

Export document(s) to plain SVG format, without sodipodi: or inkscape: namespaces and without RDF metadata.

=item B<-p> I<PRINTER>, B<--print>=I<PRINTER>

Print document(s) to the specified printer using `lpr -P PRINTER'.
Alternatively, use `| COMMAND' to specify a different command to pipe to,
or use `> FILENAME' to write the PostScript output to a file instead of printing.
Remember to do appropriate quoting for your shell, e.g.

inkscape --print='| ps2pdf - mydoc.pdf' mydoc.svg

=item B<-s>, B<--slideshow>

Show given files one by one, switching to the next one by any key or mouse event.

=item B<-t>, B<--export-use-hints>

Use export filename and DPI hints stored in the exported object (only with --export-id).
These hints are set automatically when you export selection from within Inkscape.
So, for example, if you export a shape with id="path231" as /home/me/shape.png at 300 dpi from document.svg using Inkscape GUI, and save the document,
then later you will be able to reexport that shape to the same file with the same resolution simply with 

inkscape -i path231 -t document.svg

If you use --export-dpi, --export-width, or --export-height with this option,
then the DPI hint will be ignored and the value from the command line will be used.
If you use --export-png with this option,
then the filename hint will be ignored and the filename from the command line will be used. 

=item B<-w> I<WIDTH>, B<--export-width>=I<WIDTH>

The width of generated bitmap in pixels.
This value overrides the --export-dpi setting (or the DPI hint if used with --export-use-hints). 

=item B<-x>, B<--bitmap-icons>

Use bitmap (XPM) icons in the GUI instead of SVG ones.
By default, Inkscape raterizes icons on-the-fly from share/inkscape/icons/icons.svg.
Use this option to turn this off if there is any problem with SVG icons. 

=item B<-y> I<VALUE>, B<--export-background-opacity>=I<VALUE>

Opacity of the background of exported PNG.
This may be a value either between 0.0 and 1.0 (0.0 meaning full transparency, 1.0 full opacity) or between 1 and 255 (255 meaning full opacity).
If not set and the -b option is not used,
then the page opacity set in Inkscape in the Document Options dialog will be used (stored in the inkscape:pageopacity= attribute of sodipodi:namedview).
If not set but the -b option is used,
then the value of 255 (full opacity) will be used. 

=item B<-z>, B<--without-gui>

Do not open the GUI (on Unix, do not use X server); only process the files from console.
This is assumed for -p, -e, and -l options. 

=item B<--usage>

Display a brief usage message.

=back

=head1 KEYBINDINGS

To get a complete list of keyboard and mouse shortcuts, view doc/keys.html, or use the Keys and Mouse command in Help menu from the GUI to see an SVG chart.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The preferences.xml configuration file located in ~/.inkscape/ is used
to customize the application settings for the user.  

=over 8

=item B<interface> 

The B<interface> element(s) of the config file is used to set parameters
related to the GUI interface, such as the open/closed status of various
GUI elements, etc. 

=item B<group id="documents">

The documents group is used for containing the recent files list.  Each
document is listed with its uri (path) and name indicated.

=item B<group id="template">

The template group is used for storing parameters related to blank
documents. 

=item B<group id="tools">

The tools group is used for storing the user style preferences for
different event contexts (i.e., shapes, freehand or calligraphic stroke
properties, etc.).

=item B<group id="palette">

The palette group allows setting of dash styles.  This allows you to
define the stroke lengths for different kinds of dashes.

=item B<group id="dialogs">

The dialogs group allows persisting the position and width of each of
the dialogs in the application, so that they'll start up in the last
place the user had them at the next time the app is run.

=item B<group id="printing">

The printing group is for storing different printer settings.  Each
setting is identified with an id.  Properties include I<bitmap>
(true/false), I<resolution>, and I<destination>.

=item B<group id="options">

The options group allows persisting various user selected options
including I<nudgeddistance>, I<rotationstep>, I<cursortolerance>, and
I<dragtolerance>. 

=back

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

The program returns zero on success or non-zero on failure.

A variety of error messages and warnings are printed to STDERR or
STDOUT.  If the program behaves erratically with a particular SVG file
or crashes, it is sometimes useful to look at this output for clues.
For example, it may indicate if a given SVG file contains elements or
attributes that are not yet supported by the codebase.

=head1 EXAMPLES

While obviously B<Inkscape> is primarily intended as a GUI application,
it can be used for doing SVG processing on the commandline as well.

Print an SVG file:

    inkscape filename.svg -p '| lpr'

Export an SVG file into PNG:

    inkscape filename.svg --export-png=filename.png -w600 -h400

Convert an Inkscape SVG document to plain SVG:  

    inkscape filename1.svg --export-plain-svg=filename2.svg

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

B<DISPLAY> to get the default host and display number.

B<TMPDIR> to set the default path of the directory to use for temporary
files.  The directory must exist.

=head1 FILES

B<$HOME>/.inkscape/preferences.xml - The user's preference settings. 

B<$HOME>/.inkscape/extensions.xml - The filter programs to be used in
the application.

=head1 NOTES

Ctrl, Shift, Alt modify dragging and clicking behaviour in most tools. Watch the statusbar
for helpful hints.

To rotate an object, click it to select with Selector tool, then click again to enable
rotation handles.

The Import command works with most bitmap formats (PNG, BMP, JPG, XPM, GIF etc.) and SVG
vector images. The Open command can handle only SVG files.

The Export command only exports bitmaps in PNG format. To export into PS, EPS and other
vector formats, use Save As.

A Wacom tablet will work with Inkscape if it is configured to act as a regular pointing
device. We do not support pressure/tilt sensitivity or any tablet-specific
features yet.

It works "out of the box" with Apple's X server, but with XFree86 you
will need to have the "SendCoreEvents" option turned on if you do not
already.  It does not seem to work as well under Windows.


=head1 BUGS

Many bugs are known; please refer to the website for reviewing the
reported ones and to report newly found issues.  Here are some workarounds:

When importing svg generated with ill2svg, all paths are usually grouped.
Ungroup these manually.

If you use gradients and stretch the icon of the saved file in Nautilus,
you'll notice that the gradients don't render right.  This is a
well-known problem in Nautilus/RSVG and can be worked around by
specifying the gradient as 'userspaceinuse' in the gradient editor.

See also the Known Issues section in the Release Notes for your version (file `NEWS').

=head1 AUTHORS

This codebase owes its existance to a large number of contributors
throughout its various incarnations.  The following list is certainly
incomplete, but serves to recognize the many shoulders on which this
application sits:

=head1 HISTORY

The codebase that would become Inkscape began life in 1999 as the
program Gill, the GNOME Illustrator application, created by Raph
Levien.  The stated objective for Gill was to eventually support all of
SVG.  Raph implemented the PostScript bezier imaging model, including
stroking and filling, line cap style, line join style, text, etc.  
Raph's Gill page is at http://www.levien.com/svg/.  Work on Gill appears
to have slowed or ceased in 2000.

The next incarnation of the codebase was to become the highly popular
program Sodipodi, led by Lauris Kaplinski.  The codebase was turned
into a powerful illustration program over the course of several
year's work, adding several new features, multi-lingual support, porting
to Windows and other operating systems, and eliminating dependencies.

Inkscape was formed in 2003 by four active Sodipodi developers, Bryce
Harrington, MenTaLguY, Nathan Hurst, and Ted Gould, wanting to take a
different direction with the codebase in terms of focus on
SVG compliance, interface look-and-feel, and a desire to open
development opportunities to more participants.
