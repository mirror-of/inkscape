The icons in this folder are in transition. The general idea is that all XPMs are moving to SVGs to better support SVG use within our SVG editor, Inkscape.

Thus, the XPMs need to be placed into icons.svg and the XPMs should be removed, or moved into some compressed historical archive.

The only graphics that will be kept as XPMs will be the cursor icons. (REJON: I"m actually in favor of trying to convert these to XPMs as well)
